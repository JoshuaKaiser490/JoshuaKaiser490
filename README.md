# Hello everyone! 👋

I'm Joshua, a 26-year-old aspiring web developer from Osnabrück, Germany. With a solid foundation in web development, I've gained experience in both frontend and backend technologies. I've honed my skills in crafting digital experiences using HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. My coding journey continues to unfold, and I'm excited to keep exploring and growing in the ever-evolving world of web development 🖥️.

## Outside the coding realm

Beyond coding, I find joy in two unique areas:

- The meticulous art of car detailing 🚗, where I indulge my love for automotive perfection.
- The enchanting world of Ball Pythons 🐍, where my fascination for these majestic creatures thrives.

Let's connect, collaborate, and embark on this coding journey together! 🚀
