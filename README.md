# Hello everyone! 👋

I'm Joshua, a 26-year-old aspiring web developer from Osnabrück, Germany. Currently at the beginning of my journey into web development, fueled by a passion for learning and a strong interest in crafting digital experiences. My coding adventure is just unfolding, and I'm excited to explore the wide world of web development, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond 🖥️.

## Outside the coding realm

Beyond coding, I find joy in two unique areas:

- The meticulous art of car detailing 🚗, where I indulge my love for automotive perfection.
- The enchanting world of Ball Pythons 🐍, where my fascination for these majestic creatures thrives.

Let's connect, collaborate, and embark on this coding journey together! 🚀
